## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- BEM
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vercel

### What I learned

I learned more about working with SVG images, and also CSS transitions which I have not used before. It was also good general practice as I continue using Sass and BEM methodologies.

### Continued development

I am eager to continue improving my Sass and BEM, making sure to maintain good semantic HTML as well. I also enjoyed the CSS transitions and would like to continue becoming better with them. I found that while I spent time playing with the transitions and element positions, it paid off with them looing smooth and consistent positioning of elements like the share button.

### Useful resources

https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css-triangle/

- [Triangle in CSS](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css-triangle/) - This helped me to create a CSS triangle for the bottom of the share bar when viewed on larger screens.
- [MDN SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Getting_Started) - This helped with understanding SVG files and how to manipulate them for correct sizing and placement.
- [MDN Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition) - Helped to learn transitions for the share bar.
